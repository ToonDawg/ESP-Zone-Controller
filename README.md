# Project: Smart Temperature Control - ESP32 & React Native IoT Application

## Overview

Born out of a need to better regulate the temperature of our ducted air conditioning system at home, this IoT project is a blend of utility and innovation. Utilizing ESP32 with React Native, the application offers a user-friendly interface while ensuring robust backend operations, thanks to Azure Functions and Azure IoT Hub.

## Key Features

- **Front-End**: Designed with React Native for a cross-platform, intuitive user experience.
- **Device**: Uses ESP32, programmed through the Arduino SDK for dependable hardware performance.
- **Back-End**: Relying on Azure Functions for a serverless architecture that's both scalable and easy to manage.
- **Communication**: Employs Azure IoT Hub for secure MQTT communication between the device and back-end.

## Technologies Used

- React Native
- Arduino SDK
- Azure Functions
- Azure IoT Hub
- MQTT Protocol

## Purpose & Impact

The project serves a dual purpose. On one hand, it meets a practical need by giving us fine-grained control over our home's air conditioning system. On the other, it demonstrates a high-level understanding of diverse workplace systems, combining hardware and software to create a comprehensive, well-rounded solution.
